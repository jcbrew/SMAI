                                <h2>Master Chotoku Kyan</h2>
                                <p>Chotoku Kyan was born in Shuri, Okinawa in December 1870 and was the first son of Chofu Kyan. Chofu Kyan had been a descendant of the fourth Ryukyuan king, Shoshi. Kyan (also sometimes pronounced Kiyuabu) was born a frail child, but through his martial arts training he developed into a strong adult and his health improved much. He had begun his training in karate-do at the age of five years old.</p>

                                <p>Kyan was known in Okinawa as &apos;Chan mig-wa&apos; or &apos;small-eyed Kyan&apos;, and was known by this nickname because his eyes were small and weak. Despite this handicap, he went on to become a great master. In fact, he was one of the most knowledgeable masters of his time, as he studied both the Shuri-te and the Tomari-te styles of karate. He studied Shuri-te from Sokon Matsumura and Anko Itosu and studied Tomari-te from Oyadomari Pechin, Maeda Pechin and Kosaku Matsumora. Kyan&apos;s teaching combined the elements of both of these styles of karate, with his students originally calling his system &apos;migwa-te&apos;, but later it became known as &apos;Sukunaihayashi-ryu&apos;.</p>

                                <p>Kyan enjoyed traveling a good deal. During his martial arts career he journeyed to Taiwan, where he brought back the kata Ananku to Okinawa. He also visited one of Okinawa&apos;s off-lying islands and learned Tokumine no Kun (bo kata) there. Tokumine Pechin had been a lord in Okinawan, but had been banished to the Yaeyama Islands after having being involved in a fight with 30 constables in the red-light district.</p>

                                <p>Chotoku Kyan lived in Shuri until he was about thirty years old and then he moved to Kadena, where he opened his own dojo. He lived in the village of Yomitan, where a karate man called Yara taught him the Kusanku kata. In addition to Kusanku kata (which became his favourite), he learned other kata; from Sokon Matsumura he learned Naihanchi and Gojushiho, from Kosaku Matsumura he learned Seisan, Oyadomari taught him Passai and Maeda Pechin taught him Wanshu. Kyan later developed his own versions of the katas Chinto and Passai, and he even learned tree fighting which is linked to the Okinawan monkey dance &apos;saru mari&apos;.</p>

                                <p>Because of his reputation, Kyan was often challenged. It is alleged that he fought many actual fights but was never defeated. Kyan was highly adept at body shifting. Since he was a small man, he used this type of body movement (known as tai sabaki) to defeat his opponent. His technique was to never back up, but rather to move forward rapidly and strike, or block and counter attack immediately.</p>

                                <p>Two of Chotoku Kyan&apos;s top students were Ankichi Arakaki and Shimabuku and it is said that they accompanied their teacher almost everywhere and were inseparable from him. Kyan enjoyed rooster fighting very much, in fact he often entered his own roosters in these fights. One anecdote reveals something of Kyan&apos;s abilities as a martial artist, by telling that on this particular occasion he attended one of these rooster fights and had his own rooster in a firm grip under his arm. His students, Arakaki and Shimabuku, decided to test their masters skill and started a fight with a couple of the local men. Once the fight got started they left and hide in some nearby bushes. When Kyan came over to see what was happening, and to see where Arakaki and Shimabuku were, the enraged men attacked him. Kyan is said to have fought with the men and defeated them all. What was so unique about this occasion was that during the entire fight, Kyan had kept a firm hold on his rooster - he fought them all with only one hand and his feet. Arakaki and Shimabuku watched the whole fight from their hiding place and were amazed by his skill and composure.</p>

                                <p>Kyan felt strongly about the ancient code of Bushido and felt that every martial artist should follow it totally. He was both a perfectionist and a disciplinarian, in both his own training and also his teaching. He believed that self-discipline and social order and justice went hand in hand. He was also quoted as saying &quot;superior conditioning can only be built on relentless effort. The size of one&apos;s body is irrelevant&quot;.</p>

                                <p>Master Chotoku Kyan died Ishikawa City, Okinawa, on 20th September 1945 - he was 76 years old.</p></div>

                                <h2>Master Choki Motobu</h2>

                                <p>
                                    In Japan there is a phrase, Jissen, which is used to distinguish real martial arts from what has been referred to as &apos;garden party&apos; Karate. Jissen literally means real fighting. It is many times used in conjunction with Karate to establish the difference between combat effective martial arts and what might best be called tournament Karate.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Jissen Karate is many times attributed to Choki Motobu, who was considered by many the greatest Karate master to have ever lived. During his whole life he is known only to have been beaten in combat by two individuals, one being Kentsu Yabu, a veteran of the Pacific War (World War II). It is believed that it was his war time combat experience that allowed Yabu to defeat Motobu. The other was his brother, Choyu Motobu, who had been trained in the family art of Gotente, and had the advantage of superior training. After the incident, however, Choki became a devoted student of his older brother&apos;s art. It is also known that at one time he and a friend were attacked by a gang of twenty five and in his desire to protect his untrained friend, Choki Motobu dived into battle against all twenty five, and after hurting and knocking down many of the number, the others ran rather than face the fighting fury of this great martial artist.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In his youth Choki Motobu, having been born in an aristocratic family, was constantly getting in trouble, and fights, more from the expectation of being treated with respect, that was not forthcoming, than from any inherent meanness. There are those who say that Choki was crazy, mean spirited, and a belligerent fighter, and yet among those who knew him well, he was a refined gentleman, with good manners, and a quiet but humorous nature. Yasuhiro Konishi, Choki Motobu&apos;s main interpreter on Japan, said that those who ran afoul of the man usually did so because they started to treat him with disrespect, acting like he was a country bumpkin from Okinawa. While Konishi said that Motobu was basically a man of peace, who had to live down the reputation of his wildness in youth, he was not one to suffer insult well and this lead to many confrontations, in which the wise apologized and sought recompense, and the foolish ended up knocked out or demonstratively beaten.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Choki Motobu referred to his art as Kempo and was very much a specialist in the use of unusual fists associated with Okinawan Karate. His favorite technique was the Ippon Ken Zuki, forefinger knuckle fist thrust, which he had developed to a very powerful level. It was said that he could actually strike a Makiwara full power with this weapon. In his famous battle with the European heavyweight boxing champion, it is believed that this was the punch which knocked the opponent out.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    The Jissen Kempo of Choki Motobu could be thought of to consist of certain concepts which constitute the nature of real combat. First of all, real fighting martial arts, are to be only used when your life is on the line. It is to be used to defend yourself or another, from serious injury or death. Thus the basic attitude is one of don&apos;t fight if it is not necessary. It is said that it took Choki Motobu a long time to realize this principle, but that once he did, he held to it quite well. The main two reason not to fight frivolously are simply, you may hurt your opponent and two you may get hurt yourself. It is said that after his battle with the European boxer, the man was placed on board a ship to be sent home, but died before he made it there. And in his battle with Kentsu Yabu, both men were banged up badly after the fight. It may have been these two events which turned Motobu away from fighting and towards a more peaceful lifestyle.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    One other important aspect of Jissen Kempo is that it included all the techniques of combat. From his Karate instructors; Kosaku Matsumora and Yasutsune Itosu; Choki Motobu learned the most important aspects of blocking, punching, striking, and kicking. From his brother Choyu; Choki learned how to throw, joint lock, and grapple in the Okinawan fashion.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In comparison, Shiai Karate, or contest martial arts, develops a &apos;be aggressive&apos; attitude, which may be fine in regard to a sporting match, but can be dangerous on the street. The idea of contest martial arts is to win and not lose. It is to score points without allowing the other person to score as many. All sports, including the most rugged of contests, have to have limited techniques. In actual combat, self defense, the eyes, throat, and groin, are the most targeted points. Yet in contests, in order for the competitors to survive and have a certain level of safety, these are off limits, with the exception of the groin. But even the groin is not targeted as in a self defense situation. In contests, cups are worn, and while strikes may be allowed, in actual self defense, women have reported the most effective groin technique, is to grab the testicles and squeeze until the assailant is unconscious or helpless.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Choki Motobu passed his realistic methods of developing Jissen skills to many different individuals. While he did not create a particular Ryu that has a direct lineage from him and is considered his own particular method, his Kempo actually influenced the development of many different systems and in particular the Kihon Kumite, basic sparring, drills of many styles.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    There are three styles that reportedly were created by Choki Motobu and in some cases are suppose to have been passed on to certain individuals. According to Robert Trias, Choki Motobu created the Shorei Ryu style and this was passed on to him through a Chinese master after World War II. Trias modified the system by adding certain Goju Ryu Kata to the curriculum, thus creating his own style of Shorei Goju Ryu Karate. Shuri Ryu was also attributed to Choki Motobu by Yasuhiro Konishi who eventually passed the system on to Robert Trias, as the man most preserving Motobu&apos;s art. In Japan itself, the late Tatsuo Yamada called Choki Motobu&apos;s system Motobu Ryu in his teachings of Karate history. In Okinawa the term Motobu Ryu is applied to the family art of Gotente which was passed to Seikichi Uehara. Thus in discussing Motobu Ryu it is important to know whether the term is used in the Japanese manner referring to Choki Motobu&apos;s art, or in the Okinawan manner referring to Choyu Motobu&apos;s art. There is a great deal of difference, with the main one being that Choyu Motobu&apos;s art is taught in the most ancient manner without prearranged Kata.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Choki Motobu taught many students during his long lifetime of seventy three years. Among his students were; James Masayoshi Mitose, Yasuhiro Konishi, Tatsuo Yamada, Shoshin Nagamine, Shinsuke Kaneshima, Yukimori Kuniba, Shinyei Kaneshima, Katsuya Miyahira, Chozo Nakama, Tsuyoshi Chitose, Tatsuo Shimabuku. Eizo Shimabuku, and Shigeru Nakamura. Among the many styles which are directly influenced by what Choki Motobu taught, especially in regard to Kihon Kumite and an intelligent application of techniques in Jissen, real fighting, are; Shorei Goju Ryu, Shuri Ryu, (Koga Ha) Kosho Shorei Ryu, Yamada Ryu, Isshinryu, Tozan Ryu, Shobayashi Shorin Ryu, Matsubayashi Shorin Ryu, Kobayashi Shorin Ryu, Chito Ryu, Nakamura&apos;s Okinawan Kempo, Ishimine Ryu, Shinto Shizen Ryu, Motobu Ha Shito Ryu, and Kenshinkan Ryu. Then are many modern systems which have been derived from these previously mentioned ones which owe much of the reality of their training, and the practice of Kumite, to Choki Motobu.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Shoshin Nagamine admits that in his training he teaches his students the skills of Kumite as taught to him by Choki Motobu. Motobu taught that distancing was the most important factor to delivering a punch, Seiken Zuki, with fatal force. He explained that too far away, and not enough power would be in the technique at contact, but to be too close will keep the technique from developing full power. Thus it was important to master distancing. And for those situations where one was too close it was important to be able to strike properly with Uraken and Ippon Ken Zuki. In the Kumite of Shodai Soke Shoshin Nagamine&apos;s Matsubayashi Shorin Ryu are the lessons and skills as taught by Choki Motobu.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    There are several systems today which are very involved in the fighting sports which have been developed from the art of Karate. Each of these Shiai Karate styles, feel that they represent the best of true fighting skills, with some of them being the systems listed above which were influenced heavily by Choki Motobu. It is a shame that those of these contest styles never grew in the same manner that Motobu did. In his youth, and due to the fact that he was royalty in a time when it no longer held any meaning, Choki Motobu engaged in many battles, to uphold his honor. And many of these styles insist on hard fighting contests, some with bare knuckles, others with gloves and equipment, but all thinking they are teaching Jissen the way that Motobu did.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Yet according to those who knew him best, Shoshin Nagamine and Yasuhiro Konishi, Choki Motobu grew spiritually and matured in his later years. His goal was to teach and train in Karate as it should be, as a form of Jissen Kempo, real fighting martial arts. In time he realized that he did not have to fight others to reach the true depths of the martial arts, but rather he had to practice his skills in Kata and in his own unique Kihon Kumite to open his spirit to the highest levels of development. In the end, he finally conquered his greatest enemy, his own insecurity, which kept him fighting in his youth to uphold an honor which was never tarnished.

                                <h2>Master Chojun Miyagi</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953) is the founder of today&apos;s Goju-Ryu karate-do; he was responsible for taking Naha-te and formulating it into a system.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Miyagi was Kanryo Higaonna&apos;s most talented and chosen pupil. Miyagi came from a rich family of high esteem, ship-owners who imported -amongst others- medicines from China and supplied these to the royal family, the government and business houses. To prepare him for his future task to lead the family, when only eleven years old Chojun was brought to Ryuko Aragaki (1875-1961), who on his terms sent him at the age of fourteen to Kanryo Higaonna. Here Chojun Miyagi, together with Juhatsu Kyoda (1887-1967), was tutored thoroughly in Higaonna&apos;s Naha-te.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    After the death of Higaonna the well-off Miyagi, who occupied himself full-time with the study of martial arts, planned a trip to Fuzhou, the Mecca of South-Chinese fighting arts (Nan Quan), to visit the birthplace of Kanryo Higaonna&apos;s Naha-te and to pay his respects to Ryu Ryu Ko&apos;s grave. For two months Chojun Miyagi together with Aisho Nakamoto (1881-1945) stayed in Fuzhou to train and they also visited the Julianshan Fujian Shaolin Temple.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Back on Okinawa he became friends with two tea-merchants from Fuzhou Wu Xianhui (Jap. Go Kenki) and Tang Daiji (Jap. To Daiki, both of them where famous martial arts teachers. Wu Xianhui (1886-1940) came to Naha in 1912 to teach White Crane boxing and made friends with amongst others Juhatsu Kiyoda, Chojun Miyagi and Kenwa Mabuni (1889-1952).
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Together with Wu Xianhui, Chojun Miyagi left to visit Fuzhou again at the end of the twenties. Apart from Wu Xianhui who emigrated from Fuzhou to Naha in 1912, Miyagi had as already stated a good relationship with Tang Daiji (1887-1937) a Tiger Boxing (Hu Quan) master who also emigrated from Fuzhou to Naha. Introduced by Wu Xianshui, Miyagi met in February 1936 in Shanghai the famous Monk Fist (Luohan Quan) master Miao Xing (1881-1939). Miyagi is said to have trained for some time diligently with Miao Xing and other Chinese masters associated with the Jingwu Athletic Association. He also visited the national martial arts championships.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Miyagi dedicated his whole life to the development of what was called &apos;toudijutsu&apos; (China hand art) or simply &apos;te&apos; on Okinawa. In 1921 crown-prince Hirohito visited Okinawa before traveling to Europe. Due to his visit Shuri-te as well as Naha-te (by Chojun Miyagi) was demonstrated.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In 1925 Miyagi demonstrated for prince Chichibu-Nomiya and shortly after, in 1926, he founded the Okinawa Karate Kenkyu-Kai (Okinawa Karate Research Club) together with Chomo Hanashiro (Shuri-te), Choyu Motobu (Tomari-te) and Kenwa Mabuni. One year later, Chojun Miyagi demonstrated to Jigoro Kano, grappling, locking and throwing techniques and the correct use of breathing. Kano was very impressed by this toudijutsu and introduced Miyagi, accompanied by his friend Mabuni in Japan.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    At the end of the twenties and the beginning of the thirties, Miyagi, together with his -at that time- top student Jinan Shinzato (1901-1945), gave seminars and demonstrations at Japanese universities, Budo-tournaments and at the crowning festivities of crown-prince Hirohito.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In 1933 Chojun Miyagi registered &apos;toudi&apos; officially as Goju-Ryu at the Japanese regulating Budo-institution, the prestigious Dai Nippon Butokukai, the All Japan Martial Arts Association.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Later on Miyagi was distinguished by the Ministry of Physical Education, receiving the highest honour of the Dai Nippon Butokukai and was appointed representative of the Butokukai department for Okinawa.

                                    Thus Goju-Ryu karate-do -the name derived from the Bubishi- was the first and eldest karate-tradition recognized by the Dai Nippon Butokukai; its founder, Chojun Miyagi, acquired an outstanding position in karate-do.

                                    May 1934, Chojun Miyagi traveled on invitation to Hawaii where he taught and gave demonstrations until February 1935. His teachings for that matter were referred to as kempo karate.

                                    On the 25th of October 1936 the most outstanding Okinawa-masters (Chomo Hanashiro , Chotoku Kyan, Choki Motobu, Chosin Chibana, Juhatsu Kiyoda and Chojun Miyagi) assembled and changed the name toudijutsu into karate-do.

                                <h2>Chief Grand Master Shimabuku</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Tatsuo Shimabuku was born in Kyan Village in 1908, on the island of Okinawa, on Saturday, the 19th of September. After 67 years of life, 19 of them as the Soke (head) of the major Karate style Isshin-Ryu, Tatsuo Shimabuku passed away from a stroke at his home village of Agena, Okinawa, on a Friday, May the 30th, 1975.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Young Tatsuo of the family Shimabuku of the village of Agena, began his study of Karate at the age of 8 when he walked some 12 miles to the neighboring village of Shuri to learn Shuri-Tei Karate from his uncle. His uncle sent him home; obstinately he returned and was sent away several more times. His uncle finally gave in to his persistence and accepted him as a pupil.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    For about four years young Shimabuku was privileged to study Karate in the dojo of his uncle each day after completing the most menial domestic chores.He met Chokotu Kyan, who was already famous throughout Okinawa as a Karate instructor and become one of that master&apos;s leading pupils. He also studied Karate with Chojun Miyagi of the Goju style of Karate and become his best student.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Later, he again took up the study under Choki Motobu, who was virtually a legend on Okinawa.&quot;
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Still seeking more knowledge of Karate, he took up the study of the art of bo and the sai as well as the tonfa forms, from the instructors Taira Shinken and Yabikumoden who were responsible for providing Okinawa&apos;s instructors with these particular skills.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Shimabuku&apos;s reputation throughout Okinawa had reached its peak when World War II struck and during the early part of the war he did his best to avoid conscription into the Japanese Army by escaping into the countryside where he worked as a farmer. As the situation grew more and more desperate for the Japanese and as the need to press the Okinawans into service became more urgent, he was forced to flee.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    As his reputation in Karate spread among the Japanese, many soldiers began a thorough search as they wanted to study Karate under him. The officers who finally caught up with him agreed to keep the secret of his whereabouts if he could teach them Karate; it was in this manner that Shimabuku survived the war.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    After the war he returned to farming and practiced Karate privately for his own spiritual repose and physical exercise, but as the island&apos;s leading practitioner of both Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu styles of Karate, he felt a strong need to combine the various styles of Karate into one. After consulting the aged masters and the heads of schools. Shimabuku Tatsuo founded one of the world&apos;s major systems of Karate, Isshinryu.

                                    James A. Chapman began his study of Isshinryu Karate under Master Don Nagle in May of 1958. He attained the rank of Sho-Dan in the near record time of fourteen months which was awarded him in July of 1959. Soon after his discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps, he went to Jersey City and became a partner in the association of Master Nagle. His training in karate progressed favorably under Master Nagle and he received the rank of Ni-Dan in March of 1960.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    By the time he left Jersey City in October of 1960, he had attained the rank of San-Dan. He moved to Chicago where he opened a karate school in Chicago. He returned to Jersey City frequently for additional training and, in September of 1962, was promoted to the rank of Yo-Dan.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Sensei Chapman opened the Academy of Martial Arts, his second school, in Aurora, Illinois in February of 1963. In addition, he later had schools in DeKalb and Joliet under his direction.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Through countless participation in tournaments, Sensei Chapman proved to be an able and spirited competitor. He won third place in the &quot;First World Karate Tournament&quot; in 1963. His students were likewise known for their fine tournament participation. His teaching ability was well known as he had the rare talent of developing the potential of his students to its greatest efficiency. He was further honored by being elected Division Director of The Society of Black Belts of America.

                                    On May 2, 1971, Sensei James Chapman was killed in an automobile accident. Ironically, he was on his way to the funeral of his friend, Sensei Doug Noxon, who had also died in an automobile accident five days earlier.

                                <p>
                                    Angi Uezu was born January 3, 1935, in Chiyaranka City on the island of Saipan. His father was 6th generation Okinawan of Sumarai lineage from Shuri, his ancestors served under the King of Okinawa in the city of Gushikawa. In the 1930’s work on Okinawa was hard to find, so as a young man his father traveled to Saipan to find work in the sugar cane fields and start a better life. While in Saipan his father found his first wife and the mother of Angi Uezu who was the third of four brothers.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Angi’s first involvement with martial arts came in junior high school where the schools curriculum included Gojo-ryu. He didn’t like Karate because he was very much against fighting of any sort. He thought why train in Karate and get beat-up everyday learning to defend yourself when the likelihood of getting in a fight was so remote.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In 1956, he met Yukiko Shimabuku, the third daughter of Master Tatsuo Shimabuku, the well known karate master. After a short courtship and Yukiko’s prodding to get married Master Uezu went to the Kyan dojo to ask Master Shimabuku for his daughter in marriage. Master Uezu tells the story of his first meeting with the Master, &quot;As I approached Master Shimabuku’s house I could hear some very loud pounding. I walked around the corner up to the fence gate and saw Master Shimabuku punching the makiwara, he wasn’t smiling and was very intense, I thought he was getting ready for me.&quot;
</p>

                                <p>
                                    He said, &quot;I stopped at the gate and saw the master hitting the makiwara, I turned and ran, I was very scared, I thought he was mad at me and was going to hurt me.&quot; Later his mother took him over to Master Shimabuku’s and found out that the Master was pleased to have me as his son-in-law and agreed to the marriage. In 1957 after Master Uezu and Yukiko married he moved into the Master’s house, but he didn’t start karate, instead he was working many hours at one of the military bases to make money for his new family. Master Uezu recalls that Master Shimabuku was always after him to start training. Master Uezu said he always told Master Shimabuku he didn’t like karate and stayed busy working late hours at his job so he’d have a excuse not to train.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    It was around this time a good friend of his, Taba Seichi, who was training, asked him to teach him the Bo kata, Tokomine no kun. Master Uezu told his friend that he didn’t know the kata because he wasn’t training with Master Shimabuku. His friend Taba said him &quot;you live with Master Shimabuku and don’t train in karate? &quot;Why don’t you train in karate? Master Shimabuku is your father-in-law you must respect him. You have to help him teach in the dojo&quot;.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    That evening Master Uezu thought about what his friend had said and realized he was right. Master Shimabuku had given him his daughter, a house and helped him in many ways, it was his duty to respect and help the Master. The next day Master Uezu and Yukiko’s older sisters husband started training. Master Uezu said he found that he really enjoyed karate and the rigorous training and easily remembered all of the basic exercises.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Due to his loyalty and dedication he soon became one of Master Shimabuku’s top students. During the early sixties as his skills improved he became one of the top competitors on Okinawa winning many competitions and became highly regarded as an outstanding martial artist on Okinawa. He was an excellent counter fighter with an array of techniques that he worked until he considered them perfect for all types fighting.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Later, Master Shimabuku sent him to teach at many of his outlying military dojos because of Master Uezu’s English skills and teaching ability. Master Uezu taught many Marines at Camps Hansen, Courtney and Foster. In 1967, as a Yon-Dan, he took over as Master Shimabuku’s representative to go to the United States and conduct training and seminars, a yearly tradition he has kept for the past 30 years. The only time he interrupted his schedule was after his stroke in April 1994. After his recovery he resumed his seminar circuit and having people come to Okinawa to train in 1996.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In May 1975, Master Shimabuku passed away at the age of 68 starting off a chain of events that almost destroyed Isshin-Ryu on Okinawa. This along with other internal conflicts began the downfall of the largest style of karate on Okinawa at the time. Many of Isshin-Ryu’s top people went to other styles because of internal disagreements and beliefs leaving only seven senior students to include Master Uezu to carry on. This would begin the hardest test of his loyalty and dedication to his Master and Isshin-Ryu for the next 21 years.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    He recalled a time after the Master’s death when he was approached by three former friends and students of Isshin-Ryu who came to his house to get him to switch to Shorin-Ryu. The three begged him to join them, to which Master Uezu again replied &quot;I have a duty to Master Shimabuku and must remain loyal to my family&quot;. Master Uezu realized he had many people around the world that needed him to keep Isshin-Ryu alive. He knew that he must teach good Isshin-Ryu and respect Master Shimabuku because it was his duty. Master Uezu took to this challenge by going to the states for extended periods to teach and spread the word about Isshin-Ryu wherever and whenever he was asked.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master Uezu has said on many occasion, &quot;I always look straight ahead and ignore the comments that could distract me from practicing good Isshin-Ryu&quot;. Through his efforts, he gathered a large following of supporters, many skeptics and critics who met him have found him to be a genuine, and honest person who is always smiling and will talk to everyone no matter of their rank or status.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master Uezu follows his Master’s beliefs in that one must be a gentleman or lady at all times and never worry about the negative influences that can harm oneself. Through all of this Master Uezu never struck out at his detractors, to do so would have taken a way from everything he believed in. If others didn’t like what he had to offer that was okay, he respected them for their beliefs and willingness to follow their chosen path. He truly believes that you must remain focused and have a big heart to accept others for what they believe.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master Uezu says Karate is the tool that helps reach people reach their goals by training them to be strong mentally and physically. Isshin-Ryu means &quot;The One Heart Way&quot;, as Master Shimabuku truly believed karate should be used for bettering oneself. In 1987, a disagreement between the remaining top Okinawan leaders of Isshin-Ryu almost put the final nail in the coffin on Okinawa. While the others went their own ways to different styles, Master Uezu started the Okinawan Isshin-Ryu Karate Kobudo Association (O.I.K.K.A.) to keep Isshin-Ryu alive on Okinawa and support his many followers around the world.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master Uezu’s persistence and dedication to his master paid the ultimate dividend by becoming the only Isshin-Ryu association now recognized by the Prefectural government and asked by it to perform at all major karate demonstrations. The crowning achievement of his efforts to promote Isshin-Ryu came when his association was asked to perform at 1995 World Okinawan Karate Championships here on Okinawa.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    In 1996 Master Uezu finally retired and passed the torch on to Sensei Tsuyoshi Uechi, who is now the leader of Isshin-Ryu on Okinawa and the President of the O.I.K.K.A. after having trained directly under Master Uezu for over 25 years. Even in retirement Master Uezu is still constantly receiving letters from people wanting to join the O.I.K.K.A. and has never denied anyone admission to his association unless they were proven to be less than respectable.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Today he resides quietly in Gushikawa City with his wife Yukiko and his son. Even though he’s retired he isn’t far away from the dojo. Master Uezu is a frequent visitor at Sensei Uechi’s dojo to watch, however he with his enthusiasm and drive still strong he usually ends up teaching the class. Master Uezu says &quot;My wife won’t let me teach at home and is always telling me to rest. I am a karate man and this is my life I can’t rest, I have a duty to Master Shimabuku to spread his art of Isshin-Ryu&quot;.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Being the ultimate Bushido man he still practices karate everyday in his dojo, (while his wife is taking a nap), he walks 5 miles, and tells anyone who will listen the benefits of karate. This man will never rest, &quot;One day I’ll die and there will be plenty of time to rest, right now I’m too busy&quot;.

                                    Master Nagle was born on April 5th, 1938. Master Don Nagle began his study of Isshinryu karate before the close of 1955 in the Kyan (Pronounced Chun) village in Okinawa, Japan with founder Tatsuo Shimabuku.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    I talked with Grand Master Nagle several months before his death and asked him when he began studying he told me he knew it was late 1955 either November or December shortly after he arrived in Okinawa. According to Master Nagle&apos;s DD-214 he served a total of 1 year 2 months and 14 days of foreign service. During his time in Okinawa Master Nagle won the Okinawan championships as a white belt. Upon winning this championship Master Shimabuku awarded Master Nagle his personal black belt obi.

                                <p>
                                    Master Shimabuku often received complaints from the other karate Masters on Okinawa about Master Nagle. They would complain that Master Shimabuku was sending Master Nagle to embarass them and their students since he would go into their dojo and beat their black belts in kumite. Master Nagle left Okinawa as a 4th Dan.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    When Master Nagle&apos;s tour of duty on Okinawa was over he returned to the U.S. and began teaching Isshinryu Karate at Camp Lejeune NC. It was during this time that he met Captain Ernie Cates a well known Judo practitioner. Master&apos;s Cates &amp; Nagle opened a Karate/Judo Academy in Jacksonville, NC. Master Nagle often said that if it were not for Ernie Cates he would never have continued in Karate. In 1958 Master Nagle formed the 1st Isshinryu karate organization called the IKA (Isshando Karate Association).

                                <p>
                                    After his discharge from the Marines on September 11th, 1959 he returned home to New Jersey and opened his first commercial Karate Dojo at 524 Mercer Street in Jersey City.

                                    In the early to mid 1960&apos;s Master Nagle had a famous karate competition match between Master Peter Urban a student of the late Master Gogen Yamaguchi and himself in Madison Square Garden. This was certainly an exciting time in Master Nagle life.

                                    In 1964 Master Nagle visited his instructor Tatsuo Shimabuku for a short time in Pittsburg PA. In 1966 Master Shimabuku came to visit with Master Nagle in NJ for 2 weeks.

                                    During the mid 60&apos;s Master Nagle branched out with student Joel Buchholtz and opened a Karate School in Bayonne, NJ on the 2nd Floor of a building on 22nd St. and Broadway. In 1969 Master Buchholtz &amp; Nagle purchased a building on 19th St. at 412 Broadway in Bayonne, NJ.

                                    In 1977 Master Nagle joined the Narcotics Squad of the Jersey City Police Department. During his years of service with the police the name &quot;Nagle&quot; became synonomous with fear. Several times Master Nagle dressed up in female attire to trap an unsuspecting narcotics suspect. Master Nagle related a story that one time he was in the middle of one of these narcotics groups they had under suspicion and one of them said, &quot;I&apos;m going to get that Nagle&quot; while he was standing not 2 feet away. Master Nagle was known to go up to a basketball court where the local &quot;tough&apos;s&quot; would shoot hoops and hang out while on duty walk under the net and from a dead stand still jump up in the air and kick the net with his foot. Upon landing he would then say, &quot;Now who wants to fight me?&quot;

                                    Master Mark Wzorek told me of a time at Master Nagle&apos;s dojo. During this time he related that everyone was sparring and Master Nagle walked in and locked the door. Master Nagle then told everyone that they were not leaving untill everyone had blood on them. At the end only Master Wzorek was without any blood and so he had to spar with Master Nagle. Needless to say he too had blood by the end of that fight. This was a time of no pads and full contact matches. One account I read stated that Master Nagle would apprehend between 8 to 12 men at one time singlehandedly. When backup arrived they were already all layed out.

                                    Master Ralph Passero noted that few people practice Isshinryu Karate the way Master Nagle did. His lightening fast technique overwhelmed his opponets. Master Nagle was always very thin and I am sure this aided him with his lightening fast speed and technique. Master Nagle&apos;s wild side earned him a reputation in Okinawa and he was quickly tabbed as, &quot;The Laughing Red Devil&quot; because of his fighting attitude and spirit. &quot;Alot of time on the job perps (Perpetraitors) see me as a little guy explained the 5 ft 8 Nagle. To Someone 6&apos;3 or 6&apos;4 I would announce that they are under arrest and they think I am going to have a little problem with that. But I don&apos;t have a problem. If they decide to use force I just use superior force. I am proud to say that I never put anyone in the hospital as a result of an apprehension.&quot;

                                    The Late Master Don Bohan related an account of Master Nagle. He&apos;s so thin and light no one can believe he&apos;s as fast and as powerful as he is. I remember an incident some years back I was doing some bartending and Sensei Nagle and another guy came into the bar. I was a black belt at the time and considered myself pretty fast. A fight started and nine guys attacked the Sensei. Before I could come from behind the bar he and the other guy had put them all away. And it was Sensei who had done most of the work. In Just seconds! nine guys! It was almost unbelievable.

                                    Master Ed McGrath &quot;The Voice Of Karate&quot;, once said, &quot;His speed was fantastic! even after we had achieved high ranks and had won championships at the various tournaments Sensei Nagle could still do just about anything he wanted to us. He could actually call his shots in kumite in the dojo. He would say, &quot;I&apos;m going to hit you with my left fist on the right side of your face and then he would procede doing it three times in a row. He was so fast you just couldn&apos;t stop him.
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master Joel Buchholtz once stated, &quot;Master Nagle was constantly in trouble with Tatsuo Shimabuku because of his desire to learn and learn as much as possible. He would visit other dojo&apos;s and fight the best black belts he could find. Master Shimabuku would receive complaints from the other Sensei&apos;s who thought he was sending Mr. Nagle around to make their best men look foolish because this was just what he was doing. We had a 15 ft ceiling with a ball hanging from it. Sensei Nagle would throw kicks at the ball maybe 10 ft from the ground and would hit it. He would do it from a standing position and then he&apos;d have the ball raised and he would keep on throwing kicks untill he couldn&apos;t hit it anymore. The Ball might be right up to the ceiling 15 feet from the ground and he&apos;d keep kicking it until he couldn&apos;t raise his feet. Then he&apos;d be ready to start his class.

                                <p>
                                    Sensei Nagle never did look for trouble. One day while on duty he went into a bar to check it out. He was spotted as a cop and surrounded by 5 guys. He did not want to make a big scene and have anyone get hurt and he wasn&apos;t in a position where he could fight without hurting anyone and he could have gotten hurt himself. So he screamed and charged and as the startled guys jumped back he headed for the door. He got about 2 feet outside the door then he turned and waited and he caught them one at a time as they came through the door.&quot;

                                <p>
                                    One Sensei once said, &quot;So how would you like to be the loser who tangles with Nagle? without knowing who he is. One of my students was picked up in a narcotics rap in Jersey City by Nagle. He didn&apos;t know who he was up against and said I&apos;m a black belt. And stated his name. Nagle didn&apos;t tell him anything. My student made the wrong move and Nagle took him out with a shuto to the forehead and a round house to the chest. The kid never knew what hit him.&quot; Sensei Nagle explained when reminded of the incident, &quot;I&apos;m issued a gun and can use it. But I&apos;d rather solve these problems without hurting anyone.&quot;

                                    Master Don Bohan said, &quot;He was a fabulous teacher and he not only taught us how he taught us why.&quot;

                                    Grand Master Peter Urban said, &quot;He was the toughest fighter I ever fought! He was one of the Great Pioneers of Karate.&quot;

                                    Master Aaron Banks said, &quot;He represents to me what the American karate Ka should be. He is one of the country&apos;s top Karate Ka&apos;s and one of it&apos;s finest men.&quot;

                                <p>
                                    Master Chuck Merriman said, &quot;Karate is in dire need of men of Mr. Nagle&apos;s dignity, integrity and leadership.&quot;
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Master George Coffield said, &quot;Sensei Nagle is a credit to karate and karate needs more men like him.&quot;
</p>

                                <p>
                                    Some people Master Nagle met and had friendships with include; Peter Urban, Bruce Lee, George Coffield, Pete Siringano Sr., Michael DePasquale Sr, George Dillman, Chuck Merriman, Chuck Norris, and Aaron Banks. Master Nagle chose to stay in the background not in the limelight. He never had to prove anything to anybody and it wasn&apos;t his way to puff himself. His joy came from making you feel good.

                                    In the 1987 Master Nagle accepted 10th Dan at the request of the present day senior ranking leaders of Isshinryu. He really did not want to do this but did it for Isshinryu. Master Nagle said several times before he died that he often thought he would go back to 8th dan so as to stem the tide of so many wanting to be 10th dan. In the Late 80&apos;s Master Nagle teamed up with Master Harold Long in an attempt to unite Isshinryu karate.

                                    For a time Master Nagle tried to unite Isshinryu with a new karate organization the UIKF (United Isshinryu Karate Federation). In November of 1990 a banquet was held in honor of Master Nagle. In 1990 Master Nagle received Letters of commendation from the General Comandant of the US Marine Corps, The US Congress, and the Govenor of NJ. In 1992 Master Nagle tried a run for sheriff in Hudson County. In 1992 Master Nagle also did a seminar in Florida for Master Joe Murphy. In 1995 Master Nagle did a seminar with Master A.J. Avincula in New Jersey for Masters Nash, Kim and Marriner.

                                    In 1998 Master Nagle called a meeting of his senior students and followers to discuss his wishes should he pass away. Master Nagle&apos;s love was always for his students and Isshinryu. Master Nagle was about being on the deck with his students that is where his true love was. Several months before he died he had a slight stroke. I can remember visiting him in Bayonne Hospital and he was up and around the next day. Months later he had a heart attack a week or so before he died. While in the hospital I was told he would throw a flurry of punches to set off the heart monitors. The nurses would come running in and yell at him and he would say to them, &quot;What are you going to do throw me out I don&apos;t wanna be here anyway.&quot; He told one of his senior students that he was going to get out of bed, do a few laps around the hospital and then beat him up. Right to the end he was as fast as he ever was. During the last few years before he died he worked as a deputy US Marshall working in the courts as a security officer.

                                    Master Nagle&apos;s philosophy was this, &quot;It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deeds. Master Don Nagle passed away on August 23rd, 1999 at the age of 61. Master Nagle will be sorely missed by all we love you Sensei. Oss!

                                    Upon meeting Sensei James Chapman, a student of Master Don Nagle, he began his studies in Isshinryu. After obtaining his dan grade, he moved to Detroit and combined forces with Sensei Ken Pittaway around 1963. Together they founded the first Isshin-Ryu dojo in Michigan, the Academy of Martial Arts. Shortly thereafter, they opened a second dojo in Inkster, Michigan, about 10 miles west of Detroit. The Inkster site became Sensei Noxon&apos;s home dojo. His top student was Master Willie Adams.
